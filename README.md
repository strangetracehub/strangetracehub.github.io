# Strange Trace

**Strange Trace** is an anonymous, minimalist marketplace for selling and browsing intimate items.

This site allows users to:

- Post items without registration â€” a random seller nickname is generated automatically.
- Upload preview photos, which are blurred by default.
- Charge Â£1 for preview access and full item description.
- Charge full price to unlock delivery instructions.
- All content is treated as digital access â€” no refunds are supported.

## ðŸ§  How it works

1. A visitor is assigned a unique nickname (e.g. `ShyBunny042`).
2. They can list items by uploading photos and setting a price.
3. Buyers see blurred previews with the option to **unlock for Â£1**.
4. After unlocking, buyers can choose to **pay the full price**.
5. A message informs them that:
   > By proceeding, you agree to receive access to digital content and delivery terms.  
   > All sales are final and non-refundable.
